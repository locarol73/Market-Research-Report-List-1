<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Area CCD Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interline Transfer</li><li>Frame Line Transfer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Area Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) image sensors have two primary types: Interline Transfer and Frame Transfer. Interline Transfer allows for simultaneous exposure and readout by utilizing adjacent vertical columns for charge storage, enhancing continuous imaging capabilities. In contrast, Frame Transfer moves the entire frame of captured data to a separate storage area, which improves readout speed but requires a brief exposure interruption. Both types cater to distinct applications in photography, scientific imaging, and video, balancing speed and image quality.</p></p>
