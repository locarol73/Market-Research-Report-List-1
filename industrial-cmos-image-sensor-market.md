<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FSI</li><li>BSI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial CMOS image sensor market is primarily categorized into two types: Front-Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back-Side Illuminated (BSI). FSI sensors capture light directly on the surface, making them cost-effective and simpler to manufacture, but they may struggle with low-light performance. In contrast, BSI sensors improve sensitivity and dynamic range by placing the sensor circuitry behind the light-sensitive area, allowing more light to reach the photodiodes. This enhances image quality, particularly in challenging lighting conditions, making BSI sensors popular in industrial applications.</p></p>
